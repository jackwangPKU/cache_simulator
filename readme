File explaination:
1. cal_set.cpp: calculate the misses of all the sets of LLC without slices.
2. cal_set_slice.cpp: calculate the accesses and misses of all the sets of LLC with slices, finished based on the "cal_set.cpp".
3. filter.cpp: filter the traces of some set of some slice.
4. occupancy.cpp: calculate the occupancies of two co-run benchmarks using arbitrary cache allocation, including absolutely isolation, partial sharing and full sharing.
5. occupancy_backup.cpp: a backup of occupancy.cpp.
6. my_bench.cpp: produce testing cases.
7. pic_cal_set.py: draw diagrams using the output of cal_set*.cpp.
8. pic_occupancy.py: draw diagrams using the output of occupancy.cpp.

Tips:
1. To help you understand every program, you should read heading comments of every file at first.
2. All the configues of LLC can be changed in the source file.
3. Some parameters can be set from the input.
